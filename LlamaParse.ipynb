      "But no, the virus we're talking about is canine distemper. This is one of the most serious diseases a dog can get. It can also affect foxes, pandas, skunks, and raccoons. Like rabies, distemper is nothing you or your furry friend want to mess with. It can lead to some gnarly symptoms, including dehydration, vomiting, dif fi cult breathing, and odd fi ts of snapping or chomping. As the condition worsens, infected dogs can suffer grand mal seizures followed by death.\n",

Among other effects, HPV substantially increases the risk of various forms of cancer. Thankfully, there's a vaccine for HPV. The vaccine fi rst became available in 2006, after thorough testing for safety and ef fi cacy. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends HPV vaccines as part of routine vaccinations in all countries. And yet, the global HPV vaccination rate in 2018 was estimated to be only 12.2%. This low rate is a combination of limited availability and affordability in low- to middle-income nations and parents' resistance to their children receiving the HPV vaccine, especially in high-income nations.\n",

      "At some point in their lives, most people will need to decide about whether to be vaccinated for some disease, whether to have their children undergo routine vaccinations, and even whether to have their dog vaccinated. And, when it comes to vaccines for humans, sometimes vaccine skeptics have louder voices than doctors and other experts. So, it can be dif fi cult to get a clear understanding of vaccines' safety, effectiveness, and necessity for public health.

These researchers investigate what science is and how it works, its challenges and limitations, and its relationship with society. These topics are what this book is all about. Several disciplines investigate science in this way; primary among these are history, sociology, and  philosophy.  Historians  of  science  research  how  science  has  changed  over  time. Sociologists research social and cultural influences on science. This book draws from the  history  and  sociology  of  science,  but  its  main  approach  is  philosophical. This  is because we, its authors, are philosophers of science.\n",

But I philosophy of science is just the investigation of science, focused especially on questions of what science should be like in order to be a trustworthy route to knowledge and to achieve the other ends we want it to have, such as usefulness to society. This book is written from  a  philosophical  perspective,  but  it  does  not  dwell  on  philosophers'  different theories and debates about science. Instead, we aim to combine insights about science from philosophy with concrete examples to illuminate science's aims, methods, and patterns of reasoning, without getting bogged down in controversies, technical terminology, or too many details.\n",

      "The title of this book, Recipes for Science is meant to evoke two ideas. First, culinary , recipes have many variations: in what dish they are used to create, which version of the dish, and details of implementation. Different recipes are used to make bread and lasagna, bread recipes may call for leavening with yeast or baking soda, and ingredient measurements may be in weight or volume. Science is also like this. Scienti  c research fi can have many different aims and proceed using a variety of different methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, any culinary recipe employs intentional combinations of ingredients using time-tested methods to lead to a speci  c outcome. And different recipes fi for one type of food tend to have some elements in common, even if many of their features vary. So, for example, breads usually incorporate grain of some kind as a major ingredient, most use a leavening agent, and they are cooked-usually but not always by baking in the oven. There are resemblances among different breads and the recipes used to make them, even if there's no simple de  nition of bread and no one recipe fi required to make bread. Science is like this as well. Even as it proceeds in different ways, and even as there's no one overarching set of instructions or mechanical procedures that guarantees good science, there are certain generalizations that can be made about how good science is conducted.\n",

Instructors (or independent readers) can thus choose to use only the chapters that suit their needs. Each section may rely on earlier sections in the same chapter, but not later sections in the same chapter or other chapters. Instructors may choose not to assign later sections in some chapters that seem overly specialized or too dif  cult for their teaching needs. fi\n",

There are standard citation practices for ideas and words from published material such as articles, books, and encyclopedia entries. But even using a tool like a large language model (LLM) for  generating  and  editing  text  should  be  transparently  acknowledged  in  a paper.  When  you  directly  use  others'  words,  that  should  be  indicated  with quotation marks and precise citation, including page number where available. A similar point applies to paraphrases.

Failing to cite one's sources in academic writing or using parts of a text written by someone else  or  the  ideas  of  others-whether  intentional  or  not-is  plagiarism.

COP28 was also the 18th meeting of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol, which in 1997 extended and expanded the nations supporting the UNFCCC, and the fifth meeting of the parties to the Paris Agreement, signed by 196 countries in 2015.

      "International conferences about the challenge of climate change have been occurring for 30 years, with increasing consensus about the measures needed to counteract rising global temperatures. A primary goal is to limit the rise in global mean temperature-the average of all land and ocean surface temperatures-to 1.5° Celsius or below compared to preindustrial levels. This temperature change would be minor if it were a single-day temperature in one place. But a 1.5° Celsius increase in global mean temperature is a major change with radical consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of this temperature increase like a fever.  The human body maintains a relatively constant temperature in the range of 36.5°-37.5° Celsius (97.7°-99.5° Fahrenheit). When your body temperature increases 1.5° Celsius, which is nearly 3° Fahrenheit, you have a fever. If your body were suddenly that much warmer on average, day in and day out for months and years, it would be a serious medical emergency.\n",

Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, human activities that burn fossil fuels like coal and oil have resulted in carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere at unprecedented rates. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increases the heat retention of  our  atmosphere. Other human activities-primarily agricultural activities such as raising livestock-release methane, which is another greenhouse gas even more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat. These human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are so extreme that they've led to a historically unprecedented increase in the Earth's global mean temperature.\n",

Systematic research on the relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and climate change began in the 19th century, when the American engineer Marsden Manson discovered how the heat-trapping power of the atmosphere varies with only slight changes in its makeup. A few years later, the Swedish physicist and chemist Svante August Arrhenius completed calculations showing that changes in carbon dioxide also function as a 'throttle'\n",

Something  similar-perhaps  surprisingly-applies  to physics too, where it can be very hard to obtain empirical evidence that bears on some phenomena. String theory, for example, is the idea that the fundamental objects  in  the  world  are  extended,  one-dimensional  objects  called strings . Empirical  evidence  of  these  strings  cannot  be  provided  by  present-day  instruments, but string theory has been developed to account for features of fundamental physics that are well confi  rmed empirically, and string theorists work to fi   nd  nonempirical  evidence  that  bear  on  this  theory.

Sound familiar? Since you’ve gone\\nthrough a pandemic—one of the events in your lifetime that will make history—we\\nknow what you’re thinking: Covid-19!\\n\\nBut no, the virus we’re talking about is canine distemper. This is one of the most\\nserious diseases a dog can get. It can also affect foxes, pandas, skunks, and raccoons.\\nLike rabies, distemper is nothing you or your furry friend want to mess with. It can\\nlead to some gnarly symptoms, including dehydration, vomiting, dif!cult breathing, and\\nodd !ts of snapping or chomping. As the condition worsens, infected dogs can suffer\\ngrand mal seizures followed by death.\\n\\nDog owners !nd the idea of canine distemper distressing. Most want effective prevention and treatment for their pets and, if they hear of canine distemper, follow expert\\nveterinary advice. What’s tragically ironic is that some of the same dog owners who do\\nnot hesitate to vaccinate their puppies against distemper are skeptical towards vaccines\\nfor humans, discounting the advice of medical experts.\\n\\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV) is widespread worldwide; it is one of the world’s\\nmost frequently sexually transmitted diseases. Among other effects, HPV substantially\\nincreases the risk of various forms of cancer. Thankfully, there’s a vaccine for HPV. The\\nvaccine !rst became available in 2006, after thorough testing for safety and ef!cacy.\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends HPV vaccines as part of routine\\nvaccinations in all countries. And yet, the global HPV vaccination rate in 2018 was\\nestimated to be only 12.2%. This low rate is a combination of limited availability and\\naffordability in low- to middle-income nations and parents’ resistance to their children\\nreceiving the HPV vaccine, especially in high-income nations.\\n\\nAt some point in their lives, most people will need to decide about whether to be vaccinated for some disease, whether to have their children undergo routine vaccinations, and\\neven whether to have their dog vaccinated. And, when it comes to vaccines for humans,\\nsometimes vaccine skeptics have louder voices than doctors and other experts. So, it can be\\ndif!cult to get a clear understanding of vaccines’ safety, effectiveness, and necessity for public health. What can help is a sound understanding of the medical research about vaccines\\nand a deeper understanding of what makes this and other scienti!c research trustworthy.\\n\\nDOI: 10.4324/9781003300007-1\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Copyright Material - Provided by Taylor & Francis Review Copy - Not for Redistribution ** RECIPES FOR SCIENCE **\\n\\nScientists are, of course, the main practitioners of science. Other researchers have\\nas their primary focus understanding what science—and scientists—are up to. These\\nresearchers investigate what science is and how it works, its challenges and limitations,\\nand its relationship with society. These topics are what this book is all about. Several\\ndisciplines investigate science in this way; primary among these are history, sociology,\\nand philosophy. Historians of science research how science has changed over time.\\nSociologists research social and cultural influences on science. This book draws from\\nthe history and sociology of science, but its main approach is philosophical. This is\\nbecause we, its authors, are philosophers of science.\\n\\nIf you haven’t studied philosophy of science, it may sound obscure. But ***philosophy***\\n***of science*** is just the investigation of science, focused especially on questions of what\\nscience should be like in order to be a trustworthy route to knowledge and to achieve\\nthe other ends we want it to have, such as usefulness to society. This book is written\\nfrom a philosophical perspective, but it does not dwell on philosophers’ different\\ntheories and debates about science. Instead, we aim to combine insights about science\\nfrom philosophy with concrete examples to illuminate science’s aims, methods, and\\npatterns of reasoning, without getting bogged down in controversies, technical terminology, or too many details.\\n\\nThe title of this book, *Recipes for Science*, is meant to evoke two ideas. First, culinary\\nrecipes have many variations: in what dish they are used to create, which version of\\nthe dish, and details of implementation. Different recipes are used to make bread and\\nlasagna, bread recipes may call for leavening with yeast or baking soda, and ingredient\\nmeasurements may be in weight or volume. Science is also like this. Scienti! c research\\ncan have many different aims and proceed using a variety of different methods.\\n\\nOn the other hand, any culinary recipe employs intentional combinations of ingredients using time-tested methods to lead to a speci! c outcome. And different recipes\\nfor one type of food tend to have some elements in common, even if many of their\\nfeatures vary. So, for example, breads usually incorporate grain of some kind as a major\\ningredient, most use a leavening agent, and they are cooked—usually but not always\\nby baking in the oven. There are resemblances among different breads and the recipes\\nused to make them, even if there’s no simple de! nition of bread and no one recipe\\nrequired to make bread. Science is like this as well. Even as it proceeds in different\\nways, and even as there’s no one overarching set of instructions or mechanical procedures that guarantees good science, there are certain generalizations that can be made\\nabout how good science is conducted.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Indeed, the primary\\naudience we had in mind in developing this book is an undergraduate student in a\\ngeneral education course, who may not take any additional science courses in college.\\nWe asked ourselves, what would that student most benefit from knowing about how\\nscience works? What episodes from historical and current science would that student\\nbe interested to read about and contemplate?\\n\\nWe expect this book will also be useful for some more specialized or more advanced\\ncourses. These include science education courses, especially those that focus on the\\nnature of science and scienti! c reasoning; introductory philosophy of science courses,\\nespecially if supplemented with primary readings that address some of the major\\nphilosophical controversies about science; and introductory science courses, especially\\nmethods courses, when supplemented with material speci! c to the particular scienti! c\\n! eld of study.\\n\\nThis textbook was designed to be usable in its entirety in a standard semester, with\\napproximately one chapter covered per week. But, to be useful in a wide range of course\\nlevels and disciplines and for different teaching goals, we have also designed the book\\nto be modular: each chapter can be used independently from the others. Instructors\\n(or independent readers) can thus choose to use only the chapters that suit their needs.\\nEach section may rely on earlier sections in the same chapter, but not later sections in\\nthe same chapter or other chapters. Instructors may choose not to assign later sections\\nin some chapters that seem overly specialized or too dif! cult for their teaching needs.\\n\\n## use in scienti! c hypothesis-testing.

All of this affects global\\nhealth, poverty, hunger, and national security. The World Bank estimates that 200#million people will be forced to migrate between 2020 and 2050 due to the impacts of\\nclimate change. Ultimately, global warming will make the Earth less hospitable for\\nall creatures, including humans, and a more unjust place in virtue of who will suffer\\nand how this suffering will be managed. International climate change work therefore\\nincludes not just efforts to mitigate climate change but also, increasingly, attention to\\nhow to adapt human societies to a changed climate.\\n\\nGreenhouse gases work like a blanket. As incoming radiation from the Sun permeates our atmosphere, some hits the Earth and is refl ected back out to space. But greenhouse gases, such as methane (CH 4 ), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), and water vapor, trap some\\nof the heat in the atmosphere. This trapped heat warms the planet’s surface, making it\\nhospitable to life. Higher concentrations of greenhouse gases lead to a warmer planet;\\nlower concentrations lead to a cooler planet.\\n\\nChanging atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are a major factor in\\nEarth’s climate. Other factors include variations in the Earth’s orbit, the motion of\\ntectonic plates, the impact of meteorites, and volcanism on the Earth’s surface. So, our\\nclimate has never been static: it has been fl uctuating for billions of years. What’s special\\nabout the current climate changes, then? Why is this time different?\\n\\nWhat’s different is that human activities have led to extreme changes. Since the\\nbeginning of the Industrial Revolution, human activities that burn fossil fuels like coal\\nand oil have resulted in carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere at unprecedented rates. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, this increases the heat retention\\nof our atmosphere. Other human activities—primarily agricultural activities such as\\nraising livestock—release methane, which is another greenhouse gas even more potent\\nthan carbon dioxide in trapping heat. These human-caused greenhouse gas emissions\\nare so extreme that they’ve led to a historically unprecedented increase in the Earth’s\\nglobal mean temperature.\\n\\nThis discovery isn’t recent. Scientists have known since the 18th century that burning carbon-based fossil fuels releases carbon into the atmosphere. Systematic research\\non the relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and climate change began in\\nthe 19th century, when the American engineer Marsden Manson discovered how the\\nheat-trapping power of the atmosphere varies with only slight changes in its makeup.\\nA#few years later, the Swedish physicist and chemist Svante August Arrhenius completed calculations showing that changes in carbon dioxide also function as a “throttle”\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Review Copy - Not for Redistribution\\n\\nFirst, relevant expertise is important for scienti! c knowledge to be trustworthy. You\\nshould trust climate scientists to do climate science in the same way you trust your\\nmechanic with your car or your favorite restaurant with your dinner. The types of\\nexpertise required for these positions takes years, even decades, to develop. But the\\nexpertise doesn’t neatly transfer from one domain to another: don’t trust the average\\nclimate scientist to ! x your car or make you a delicious meal. Similarly, politicians and\\npolicymakers know things about political and legislative matters, but they should not be\\nlooked to as authorities on the science of climate change—regardless of whether they\\naccept its existence. To do so would be an ***appeal to irrelevant authority*** : appealing to\\nthe views of an individual who has no expertise in a ! eld as evidence for some claim.\\n\\nSecond, consensus among the relevant experts is an important indicator that the\\n! ndings are settled scienti! c knowledge. There is striking agreement among climate\\nscientists about the existence of anthropogenic climate change. Reputable scientists\\nand scienti! c societies, including the national science academies of the world and the\\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), agree that human-caused, or\\nanthropogenic, climate change is occurring. This includes virtually all climatologists. In\\n2004, the historian of science Naomi Oreskes analyzed 928 abstracts on climate change\\npublished in scienti! c journals from 1993 to 2003; none expressed disagreement with\\nthe consensus position that anthropogenic climate change is occurring. In 2010, a group\\nof researchers studied the views of the 200 climate scientists with the most extensive\\n\\nand productive publication records; more than 97% af! rmed the existence of anthropogenic climate change as described by the IPCC.\\n\\nThird, the convergence of different sources and types of evidence provides solid\\ngrounding for scienti! c knowledge. Well-established theories in physics explain how\\nheat radiation works. Physical chemistry shows how carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere traps heat. Climatologists have developed extensive\\nsources of evidence that support the same conclusions about climate change and its\\nrelationship to greenhouse gases and human activities. As we described earlier, some\\nof this knowledge goes back centuries, and a range of techniques have been used to\\namass ever-more relevant evidence. Since the 1950s, scienti! c models and computer\\nsimulations have helped scientists to make testable predictions about what would\\nhappen to the global climate in response to different changes in human activities, and\\nevidence has con! rmed those predictions.\\n\\nAnd yet, despite decisive scienti! c evidence supporting a consensus among scientists, public concern for climate change lags behind the research. According to surveys\\nfrom the Pew Research Center from 2013, 44% surveyed across 23 countries did not\\nview climate change to be a major threat; by 2018, that number had dropped to 33%\\nacross the same countries.

The contrast\\nwith basic research is ***applied research*** . Scienti! c research is applied when it makes use\\nof scienti! c knowledge to develop some tangible output, such as techniques, software,\\ndrugs, and new materials.

Scientists aiming at\\nthe production of knowledge for its own sake often rely on materials and techniques\\ncreated by scientists doing applied research, while scientists doing applied research\\noften exploit pure scienti! c knowledge in order to develop new products. Still, basic\\nand applied research are often carried out by different scientists, often using very\\ndifferent techniques, and sometimes in entirely different ! elds of science and types\\nof institutions.

These are both natural explanations of\\nnatural phenomena.\\n\\nScience is always naturalistic in what it investigates and how it explains. The meaning\\nof the term *natural* in the context of the naturalism of science can be better understood\\nby contrasting it with *supernatural* . Supernatural entities and occurrences may not be\\ngoverned by discernible regularities, may not be observable at all or not observable by\\nother people, or are just supposed to transcend the range of physical human experience. Because supernatural entities or occurrences are not natural phenomena, science\\nwon’t be able to deliver knowledge about them: they would be beyond its explanatory\\nreach. Nor does science appeal to supernatural entities or occurrences to explain natural phenomena. “A#miracle caused her to recover from disease” couldn’t possibly be a\\nscienti! c explanation, even though recovering from a disease is a natural phenomenon.\\n\\n**The methods of science**\\n\\nScience’s goal of providing natural explanations of natural phenomena isn’t all that\\nis distinctive about the nature of science. Also significant are science’s methods. One\\nimportant ingredient of these methods is closely related to the idea of naturalism: science involves ***empirical investigation***, which means using one’s senses to inform one’s\\nbeliefs about the world. What scientists see, hear, smell, touch, and so forth can all be\\nused as empirical evidence for or against some attempted natural explanation.\\n\\nThe method of empirical investigation isn’t special to science. We all use our senses\\nin everyday life to learn about the world around us, beginning as infants. You know\\nit’s a clear day because you can see and feel the sun shining through the window. But\\nscience has ! ne-tuned and adapted this method to generate certain kinds of knowledge.\\n\\nIn science, empirical investigation is explicitly used to generate ***evidence*** . Science\\nis thus based on ***evidentialism***, the thesis that a belief’s justi! cation is determined by\\nhow well it is supported by evidence. For any scienti! c claim—particularly, any natural\\nexplanation of a natural phenomenon—it must be possible to state why that claim\\nshould be believed. This evidence ultimately traces back to empirical observations, but\\nempirical evidence often con! rms scienti! c claims only indirectly. We don’t directly see\\nhuman activity increasing atmospheric CO 2, for example; rather, scientists made predictions about changes to the atmosphere, historical trends in global temperature, and\\nmore, based on this conjecture; and then they tested those predictions with empirical\\nevidence. So, evidentialism is important to science, but how evidence is gathered and\\nused is not always straightforward.\\n\\n## an epidemic in France or increased employment in Colombia, you might wonder Copyright Material - Provided by Taylor & Francis\\n\\n## how that came to be.

In general, we humans try hard to hold on to our\\nexisting beliefs, even when those beliefs are challenged. Scientists are no different.

The existence of potential confl icts of interest does not\\nnecessarily lead to bias, but transparency about them allows others to evaluate the\\npossibility of improper infl uence.\\n\\nHere’s an important example. Clair Patterson, a geochemist at Cal Tech in California,\\nled the campaign to remove lead from gasoline in the 1960s and 1970s. Leaded gasoline contained lead tetraethyl, which is extremely toxic to human and non-human\\nanimals alike. Because the campaign against leaded gasoline threatened their pro! ts,\\nthe fossil fuel industry—particularly the Ethyl Corporation—fought bitterly against\\nPatterson’s research. Among their tactics was to pay another scientist, Robert Kehoe,\\nto attest to the safety of leaded gasoline. Eventually, his dishonesty was revealed, and\\nhonest science carried the day. Lead was removed from gasoline, but only after generations of people in many countries around the world suffered from elevated lead\\nlevels in their blood, which leads to brain damage, chronic illness, birth defects, and\\nincreased death rates. Urban areas around the world still have elevated levels of lead\\n\\nin their soil from this period.\\n\\nAnother important form of protection against fl aws in reasoning involves social\\nnorms and incentives governing the scienti! c community as a whole. One such norm is\\ntrust. Scientists’ trust in one another is the glue of scienti! c communities. For example,\\ncollaborative projects on climate change involve scientists with a range of different\\nexpertise, including climatologists, ecologists, physicists, statisticians, and economists.\\nNone of these scientists alone possesses comprehensive expertise to collect, analyze,\\nand interpret the full range of evidence that bears on our understanding of anthropogenic climate change. These scientists must rely on each other and must trust one\\nanother’s scienti! c work.\\n\\nScientists also are expected to critically evaluate one another’s work by deciding whether results warrant publication, evaluating the strengths and weaknesses\\nof research ! ndings, and choosing whether and how to respond to published ! ndings. One important form of critical evaluation is attempting to replicate others’\\nresearch. In ***replication***, an experiment or study is performed again (often by different scientists) to determine whether the same ! ndings obtain. If successful, the\\nreplicated results further con! rm the ideas under investigation. If the results are\\nnot replicated, this raises doubts about the original work, such as the possibility\\nthat something unexpected was instead responsible for the ! nding.

Many people and organizations\\nare eager to lay claim to scientific legitimacy, and it’s sometimes difficult to discern\\nwhether they are entitled to it.\\n\\nThis is not a new problem. Karl Popper, the 20th-century philosopher encountered\\nin the previous section, argued that some investigations thought to be scienti! c were\\ninstead ***pseudoscience***, which means false, fake, or bogus science. Such nonscienti! c\\nactivities are designed to look enough like science to deceive people into thinking they\\nhave scienti! c legitimacy.

And yet,\\n## even though astrology is bunk, it is still promoted as a legitimate source of knowledge.

The central problem with pseudoscience is the deceptive\\nattempt to appear scienti! c and, thus, to have the ability to generate scienti! c knowledge when it doesn’t.\\n\\nIn many cases, the speci! c intent of the advocates of pseudoscienti! c theories\\nis to appeal to science’s self-correcting nature to call into doubt scienti! c ! ndings\\nsupported by enough evidence to be considered established scienti! c knowledge.\\nAnti-vaccination advocacy is like this. One popular anti-vaccination argument is that\\nchildhood vaccines increase the risk of autism. Extensive testing has demonstrated\\nclearly and conclusively that there is no causal connection between vaccination regimes\\nand the incidence of disorders like autism. This conclusion is scienti! c: it is based on\\n\\nevidence, is open to falsi! cation, and would be rejected if suf! cient evidence against\\nit were found. But existing research is so extensive and compelling that the possibility\\nof newfound discon! rming evidence is virtually nonexistent. Nonetheless, propaganda\\noutlets and anti-vaccination groups peddle misinformation, trying to induce doubt by\\nmisconstruing the relevant research and with stories of children who were diagnosed\\nwith autism after vaccination. (This does regularly happen, for the simple reason that\\nvaccination regimes and many symptoms of autism both tend to emerge in the same\\nstage of early childhood.)\\n\\nAnother example of pseudoscience is creationism and ***intelligent design***, which\\nare attempts to explain the characteristics of living organisms by appeal to supernatural events, inspired by religious teachings. For close to a century now, “creation\\nscience” and later intelligent design were effectively advocated in the United States\\nas alternative scienti! c theories to evolutionary theory, including publication of glossy\\ntextbooks and even a creationism-based alternative natural history museum. The basic\\nthought behind both creationism and intelligent design is that living organisms are so\\ncomplex that they couldn’t possibly have come about by evolution. This idea is not\\nsupported by evidence; it is actually debunked by the evidence, which, at the same\\ntime, clearly indicates the workings and effects of biological evolution. Notice that\\nthis does not imply that evolutionary theory has proven that there is no supernatural\\ninvolvement; that would be beyond the purview of science. Rather, it’s just that the\\nnatural explanation of evolution successfully accounts for the natural phenomenon\\nof complex lifeforms.\\n\\nHealthcare is a common target for pseudoscience. Besides anti-vaccination advocacy,\\nanother example is conversion therapy, which is intervention intended to change a person’s sexual orientation.

It can be dif! cult to judge whether naturopathy should be dismissed entirely as pseudoscience or\\nmight be rendered more legitimately science-based with continued development or\\nintegration into mainstream medical practices.\\n\\nHere’s another example of pseudoscience that comes from inside science. Naomi\\nOreskes and Erik Conway’s book, *Merchants of Doubt*, which also inspired a ! lm\\nof the same name, details how one group of well-respected scientists in the United\\nStates provided legal testimony and spurred research that misled the public and\\nenabled corporations to dodge responsibility for the health and environmental\\ncatastrophes of cigarettes, acid rain, climate change, and the toxin DDT. Apparently\\ninspired by their political views, these scientists misused the authority of science\\nto delay acceptance of established scienti! c knowledge that was inconvenient for\\npowerful corporations.\\n\\nAs these examples reveal, discerning science from pseudoscience can be essential for\\nhealth and safety, but doing so can be very dif! cult. Where is the line between harmless entertainment and pernicious fake knowledge, or between a new, underexplored\\nalternative idea and a cynical attempt to inspire doubt in well-established scienti! c\\nknowledge? It seems we cannot just rely on whatever individual scientists tell us to\\nbelieve. And some features of the nature of science described in the previous section\\nmight be shared by varieties of pseudoscience.\\n\\n**A checklist for science**\\n\\nWe have discussed many distinctive features of the nature of science. These include\\naiming to generate knowledge, naturalism, empirical investigation, evidentialism, falsifiability and openness to falsification, and characteristic institutional structures. Some\\npeople have advocated one or another of these as the best way to define science, as with\\nPopper’s falsificationism. Others have suggested these different features are together\\nthe hallmark features of science. We think that is the most promising approach. So,\\nwe define ***science*** as the inclusive social project of developing natural explanations for\\nnatural phenomena. These explanations are tested against empirical evidence and must\\nbe subject to open critique, refinement, and rejection.\\n\\nThe characterization of science developed here can provide a kind of checklist for\\nassessing to what extent some activity quali! es as scienti! c, as pictured in Table#1.1 .\\n\\nConsider how this characterization of science relates to our earlier example of\\nclimate change.

The proposed natural explanation\\nfor this phenomenon is that human activities have generated unprecedented levels of\\ngreenhouse gases and the warming effect of those gases.\\n\\nAll scienti! c claims must be testable, or falsi! able, with the use of empirical evidence,\\nand claims must be supported by signi! cant evidence to be accepted (or discon! rmed\\nby suf! cient evidence to be discarded). The claims that the concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases has dramatically increased since the Industrial Revolution and\\nthat the last four decades are the warmest on record (for example) are both testable.\\nWe can describe the kinds of evidence that would lead us to reject these claims, but\\nscientists have not found that evidence despite extensive investigation.
